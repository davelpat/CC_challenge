Tech challenge for CrowdCompass

* Summarize how you would approach test casing for the CrowdCompass website to ensure coverage:http://crowdcompass.com
* Take a feature on the website and create a test spec. Include technical details.
* From that test spec, generate some examples of detailed test cases. Please limit to 100.
* For those applying to positions that include automation, show off your mad skillz to us.

It's ok to make educated assumptions, such as supporting all mobile devices and browsers.

The objective is to clearly communicate competency and coverage using a well thought out approach.
